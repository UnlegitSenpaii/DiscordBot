For those who are interested here is an tutorial for an enable/disable command:
```css
//this tutorial is based on DapperDinos Tutorials!
//fist of all dont be mad that it isnt an video and you have to make things yourself not just copy and paste c;
//yes it is really simple and stupid but nevermind some ppl maybe find it interesting
        There are two ways of doing it with the args on or off or with the command !chaton or !chatoff im doing the !chaton/off command you can find out the one with the args on ur own c;
So fist of all we have to make two new .js files in a group(like simple, ...)
I have called them disable- and enablechat.js   

so first like in all other new commands we copy the code out of another file like coinflip.js
than you do the usual things in it

so now that were ready we have to make an global variable in out main file called something like global.chatstatus = true;//keep it on true you'll see later

still in the mainfile you go now to bot.on("message").. and put at the very top, if u havent already, if(message.author == bot.user) return;
than somewhere where u feel comfortable put in the code: 
if(chatstatus == false){
    message.deleate();  //this deleates every message that is sent
    and a message to the author c; you now how to make one c;;;
}//part 1
```
```css
so now we go back in out enable/disablechat.js file
now u go down to the async run
and put on enable chatstatus = true; and on disable chatstatus = false;  
you can also add an message.member.hasPermission("MANAGE_MESSAGES") check if u want for example:
if(message.member.hasPermission("MANAGE_MESSAGES")){
    chatstatus = false;
    message.channel.send("Chat has been disabled");
    console.log("Chat has been disabled by: " +  message.author.username + "ID: " + message.author)
}//and that on enable to and ure done!

//yes im bored c;
//dont reply with eeehh you could make the code simplier and shorter ... 
//yes i now but i dont care and think about the newbies they need to understand the code .-.
//rip my england
//part 2
